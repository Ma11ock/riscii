An emulated PC with a RISC II processor. See [[https://ryanmj.xyz/riscii][this page]] for an in-depth
description of the RISC II processor.

The RISC II was an experimental processor created at UC Berkeley by
Manolis Katevenis and Robert Sherburne under professors David
Patterson and Carlo SÃ©quin.  It was completed in 1983 as the successor
to the original RISC processor. It had a simple design with 32 bit
instructions, only two instruction formats, and only two addressing modes.
The RISC II served as the primary inspiration for the Sun SPARC
architecture, an early industry implementation of RISC.

Documentation on the RISC II is scarce and its technical details can
only be found in Katevenis' PhD thesis. This project exists to
preserve knowledge on this important piece of computer history.

See [[https://github.com/Ma11ock/riscii-guy][this project]] for an experimental assembler for the RISC II.
